Download Processing to get pulse sensor to output visuals.  http://processing.org/


You may have to change the P_PulseSensor_06 file's serial ports to get it to pull data from Arduino.
	You can find info on the serial ports by reading the printout when the file is run.

A_PulseSensor_06 is the Arduino sketch.  I did not modify this code.  Does not need to be imported.

RF24 Library should be imported to Arduino to allow modules to communicate with one another.  I used the "Getting Started" example to make them communicate.  No modifications nessecary.  You set tranceiver roles through using "R" or "T" flags in the serial monitor.

Used "Basic Echo Test" from https://learn.adafruit.com/flora-wearable-gps/program-flora to test the GPS unit.

If things don't look like they are working correctly, check the baud rate.  They are different for each component.
